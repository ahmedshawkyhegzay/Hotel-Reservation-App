                    <h1>Osman Ahmed Osman</h1>
                    <p> Othman was born on April 6, 1917, in the city of Ismailia, Egypt, to a poor family. When Othman reached his third year, his older brother Muhammad gave up his education and went to work to provide a stable income for the family. In his childhood, Othman often worked to provide extra income for the family.
                        After completing high school, Othman joined the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, majoring in the Civil Engineering Department. His economic condition did not differ much in that period from his childhood, as he did not have any money to bear the university fees or to pay the housing rent. However, these two problems did not last long, so he obtained a scholarship from the university, lived with his older sister, and traveled with a bicycle that he collected himself. Othman graduated from the university in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. Othman returned to Ismailia to work for his uncle, an illiterate but experienced contractor, for 18 months
