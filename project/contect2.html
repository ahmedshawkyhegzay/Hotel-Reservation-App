                                <p class="card-text"> The Great Pyramid or the Pyramid of Khufu is the only surviving monument of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is located in the Giza pyramids area in Egypt, which is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The construction of the pyramid dates back to about the year 2560 BC, when it was built as a tomb for the fourth dynasty pharaoh Khufu, and its construction continued for a period of 20 years. The construction of the Great Pyramid is a major cultural shift in the history of ancient Egypt. Khufu was influenced by his father, King Senefru, in building his pyramid. After his death, Khufu became the ruling god on earth, and it became necessary for him to think about building his tomb, which is the first national project in ancient Egypt, in which professional workers from all over Egypt participated in its construction. The Great Pyramid, with its original height of 148 meters,
                                     remained the tallest building completed by man on earth over a period of 3800 years..</p>
