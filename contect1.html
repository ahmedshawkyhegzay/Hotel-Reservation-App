                    <h1>Empain baron</h1>
                    <p>He began working as an engineering draftsman for a mining company, the Société metallurgique, and in 1878 entered the railway construction industry when he noticed that the railways and transportation in the countryside in general were not up to the standards required - at that time.
                        After the success in Belgium with a railway (Liege-Jemeppe), his companies developed railway lines in France, specifically the Paris metro.
                        He was granted the title of Baron in 1907 by King Leopold II of Belgium for his efforts in financing the colonies of the Kingdom of Belgium.
                        During the nineties after 1890, his company expanded the construction of tram lines in many European capitals and others, including Europe, Russia, China, the Belgian Congo - a colony at that time - and Cairo. His company also set up many electricity companies to supply the power needed for the tram lines that he was building in various capitals.
                        Baron Empain arrived in Egypt in January 1904 with the intention of saving one of his company's projects, which is the construction of a railway linking Mansoura and Mataria (a city on the shore of Lake Manzala - Port Said), and despite the loss of the project in that competition, which was undertaken by the British instead of his company, he remained in Egypt and did not depart from it. There is a saying about the reason for his continuation in Egypt, except that it is his love for a lady, 
                        Yvette Boghdadli, while Arab sources indicate that his love for Egypt is the reason for his survival.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">It is one of Egypt's ancient palaces with a special architectural style. 
                                    It was built by Baron Edward Empain, who came to Egypt from India at the end of the nineteenth century 
                                    shortly after the opening of the Suez Canal, so he proceeded to establish a new housing project in the Cairo desert under the name “Heliopolis”, and decided to establish his own palace in it, so he chose a design in the style of Indo-European architecture by French architect Alexandre Marcel. It was displayed during an engineering exhibition in Paris. The construction of the palace began in 1906 AD and opened in 1911 AD. Since the fifties, and with the transfer of ownership of the palace, the palace began to be neglected until the Egyptian government bought it in 2005 for its archaeological and architectural value, and the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities began restoration work in 2017, which ended with its opening in 2020
                                    . The palace is currently located in the heart of Heliopolis in Cairo.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">is  was formed in Cairo, Egypt in 1906 to develop a 25 square kilometer plot of land into the Heliopolis suburb. It was nationalised in 1960, and remained a state-owned enterprise until it was listed on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange (now the Egyptian Exchange, or EGX) in 1995 and renamed the Heliopolis Company for Housing and Developmen
                                    During World War I and II, the hotel was transformed into a military hospital for British soldiers.
                                   After World War II, air travel reduced the average tourist stay to a few days. As tourism became a mega-industry, massive hotels emerged in Egypt with interiors calculated on the basis of return per square meter. Unable to compete, the hotel became less popular
                                   In October 2003, a presidential decree allocated the Heliopolis Company for Housing and Development a 1,695-acre (6.86 km2) plot of land in the satellite city of New Cairo, as a compensation for the land that was taken to build the Cairo International Airport
